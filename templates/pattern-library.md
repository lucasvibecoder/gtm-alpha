# GTM Alpha: Cross-Client Pattern Library

**Version:** v1.0
**Role:** Module 4C — Growing reference of patterns that transfer across clients and verticals
**Status:** Active (initially empty — populated over time from Module 4B outputs)

---

## Purpose

This library captures patterns that work across multiple clients. It becomes the institutional memory of the GTM Alpha system — the consulting moat that compounds over time.

Updated after each Module 4B (Signal Performance Updater) cycle. Reviewed quarterly.

## 1. Signal Archetypes

Signals that work across verticals. Each archetype is a pattern, not a specific signal.

| Archetype | Description | Verticals Where Validated | Example Signals | Avg Composite Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**How to add an entry:** When Module 4B identifies a promoted signal that matches a pattern seen in another client engagement, add or update the archetype here.

**Starter archetypes to watch for:**
- Leadership change + pain-area hiring (new leader inherits a problem and starts staffing up to solve it)
- Tool/vendor sunset + replacement search (forced migration creates an evaluation window)
- Regulatory deadline + compliance gap (external pressure creates urgency with a hard deadline)
- Rapid growth + process breakdown (what worked at N employees breaks at 3N)
- Failed implementation + renewed search (burned by a competitor, now open to alternatives)

## 2. PVP Formats That Work

PVP deliverable types ranked by response rate across clients.

| PVP Format | Clients Used With | Avg Reply Rate | Best Deployment Timing | Why It Works | Notes |
|------------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**How to add an entry:** After each Module 4B cycle, check the PVP Performance section. If a PVP format consistently outperforms, add it here.

**Starter formats to track:**
- Competitive messaging audit (how their positioning compares to competitors)
- Signal analysis (what public data reveals about their company's trajectory)
- Benchmark report (how their metrics compare to industry standards)
- Gap analysis (what they're missing vs. best practices)
- Market map (landscape of their competitive environment)

## 3. Objection Handling Frameworks That Transfer

Response frameworks that work across verticals and personas.

| Objection Pattern | Framework | Verticals Validated | Success Evidence | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| | | | | |

**How to add an entry:** When Module 2C (Reconciliation) or Module 4B identifies an objection response that consistently works, add the framework here.

**Starter patterns to watch for:**
- "We already have a solution" → [Framework TBD based on data]
- "Not the right time" → [Framework TBD based on data]
- "Need to see ROI first" → [Framework TBD based on data]
- "Too expensive" → [Framework TBD based on data]
- "We tried something like this before" → [Framework TBD based on data]

## 4. Industry-Specific Signal Patterns

Signals that are unique to specific industries. These don't transfer but are valuable when entering a new client engagement in the same vertical.

| Industry | Signal Pattern | Clients Validated | Detection Method | Composite Score Range | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**How to add an entry:** When a signal performs well (Boost in Module 4B) and is specific to an industry vertical, add it here for future clients in the same space.

## 5. Messaging Patterns

Subject line and opening line patterns that win A/B tests across clients.

| Pattern Type | Pattern Description | Example | Win Rate (A/B tests won / total) | Verticals | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**How to add an entry:** When Module 4B declares a High-confidence variant winner, check if the winning pattern matches something seen in another client engagement. If so, add the pattern (not the exact copy) here.

**Starter patterns to track:**
- Signal-specific opener (referencing the exact trigger event)
- Question-based subject line vs. statement-based
- Pain-first vs. aspiration-first value framing
- Specific metric/number in subject line vs. qualitative language
- Short subject line (<5 words) vs. descriptive (5-10 words)

---

## Update Protocol

1. **After each Module 4B cycle:** Review the Performance Update for patterns that match or extend existing library entries. Add new entries or update existing ones.
2. **Quarterly review:** Read through the full library. Remove entries that haven't been validated by a second client engagement within 6 months. Promote entries validated across 3+ clients to "High Confidence."
3. **New client onboarding:** Before starting Module 1A for a new client, read the Pattern Library. Use signal archetypes and industry-specific patterns to seed initial signal hypotheses.

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Emerging** | Pattern observed in 1 client engagement |
| **Validated** | Pattern confirmed across 2 client engagements |
| **High Confidence** | Pattern confirmed across 3+ client engagements with consistent performance data |
