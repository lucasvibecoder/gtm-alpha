# PVP Output Template

**Version:** v1.0
**Role:** Output structure for Module 3B (PVP Generator) deliverables

---

## Usage

Adapt this template to the specific deliverable type. Not every section applies to every PVP. The structure is a guide, not a straitjacket.

The deliverable file should contain ONLY the sections below. The cover note is separate (email body, not part of the file).

---

## Template

```markdown
# [Deliverable Title]
## [Subtitle — what this analysis covers, for whom]

**Prepared for:** [Prospect Company Name]
**Date:** [Date]

---

### Key Finding

[1-2 sentences: the single most important insight from this analysis. This is what they remember if they read nothing else. Lead with the most surprising or valuable data point.]

---

### [Analysis Section 1: Title]

[The core analysis. Structure depends on PVP type:]

**For Competitive Audits:**
- Comparison table: Prospect vs. Competitor A vs. Competitor B on specific dimensions
- Each row backed by cited data (website claims, G2 scores, pricing, feature presence)
- Highlight where the prospect leads AND where they trail

**For Signal/Market Analyses:**
- Specific signals or trends observed in the prospect's market
- Data points with sources
- What comparable companies did when they saw the same signals

**For Benchmark Reports:**
- Prospect's current metric vs. industry benchmark vs. best-in-class
- Table format preferred for scanability
- Note methodology and data sources

**For Gap Analyses:**
- Current state (what the prospect does today, with evidence)
- Best practice (what leading companies do, with examples)
- Gap description with estimated impact

---

### [Analysis Section 2: Title]

[Second dimension of the analysis. Optional — include only if the PVP type warrants it.]

---

### What This Means for [Prospect Name]

[2-3 sentences interpreting the data in context of the prospect's specific situation. Not generic — reference their company, their market position, their recent moves.]

---

### Recommendations

Based on this analysis, three actions worth considering:

1. **[Action 1]:** [Specific, actionable step they can take regardless of vendor choice. Include enough detail that they could brief someone internally on it.]

2. **[Action 2]:** [Second recommendation]

3. **[Action 3]:** [Third recommendation]

---

### Sources

[Numbered list of all sources cited in the analysis. Every data point must trace back to a source here.]

1. [Source 1 — URL or publication name + date]
2. [Source 2]
3. [Source 3]
```

## Format Rules

- **Title:** Descriptive, not clever. "[Prospect Name]: Competitive Messaging Audit" not "The State of Widget Marketing."
- **Length:** 800-1200 words for the body (excluding tables and sources).
- **Tables:** Use tables for comparisons and benchmarks. They're scannable and make the analysis feel rigorous.
- **Sources:** Cite everything. Unsourced claims undermine credibility.
- **Tone:** Professional but direct. Write like a consultant who respects the reader's time, not like a marketing team trying to sound smart.
- **Vendor mentions:** Zero. The vendor ({TARGET_DOMAIN}) does not appear anywhere in the deliverable. This is about the prospect, not about selling.
